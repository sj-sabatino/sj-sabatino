Biologist | Bioinformatician | Data Scientist

This repository allows others to reproduce my work, gain access to the tools I have used and developed, 
and make contributions/suggestions.

### What I Do

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve:
- Processed large-scale genomic datasets (e.g., whole-genome sequencing, variant calling, expression data)
- Built and maintained reproducible data pipelines using tools like `Snakemake`, `Nextflow`, and `R/Python`
- Applied statistical models and machine learning for biological insight
- Created visualizations and figures for peer-reviewed publications
- Prioritized clean, well-documented code and transparent workflows
