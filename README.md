## welcome

Stephen J. Sabatino
Biologist | Bioinformatician | Data Scientist

This repository allows others to reproduce my work, gain access to the tools I have used and developed, 
and make contributions/suggestions.


### What I Do

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve:
- Processed large-scale genomic datasets (e.g., whole-genome sequencing, variant calling, expression data)
- Built and maintained reproducible data pipelines using tools like `Snakemake`, `Nextflow`, and `R/Python`
- Applied statistical models and machine learning for biological insight
- Created visualizations and figures for peer-reviewed publications
- Prioritized clean, well-documented code and transparent workflows

| [Gene Expression Clustering](https://github.com/sj-sabatino/expression-clustering) | Clustering of RNA-seq data across multiple conditions | R, PCA, hierarchical clustering, ggplot2 |
| [Reproducible Figure Generation](https://github.com/sj-sabatino/reproducible-figures) | Automating the generation of paper-ready figures from raw data | Jupyter, Matplotlib, RMarkdown |
| [Synthetic Genomics Demo](https://github.com/sj-sabatino/synthetic-genomics) | A mock project showcasing my workflow style using synthetic data | Python, documentation, testing |
